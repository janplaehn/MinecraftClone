Minecraft Project

Creator: Jan Plähn

This project includes landscape voxel generation based on perlin noise and setting trees at random positions.
You can use the arrow keys and the mouse to move around the landcape and press the left mouse button to select
and delete blocks that are in the same chunk as you. The project also includes a skybox, chunk-based frustum culling
and 4 different types of blocks: grass, stone, wood and leaf. Enjoy!
